    "Unlike in the last data set, it is difficult to define where the sunspot umbra ends and the penumbra begins. Additionally, we can see that the continuum intensity, and thus temperature are not constant. The slope is likely a signature of limb darkening, while the flatter part might be the result of a bright plage that negates this effect. It is important to be aware of these effects and disuss them, as they will effect the uncertainly in your result. "
